# Leaf Disease Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based image classification model to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model is trained on a dataset containing images from 38 different plant disease categories, including healthy and infected leaves of crops like apple, grape, potato, and tomato.
